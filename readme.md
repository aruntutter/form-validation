## Description

This is a simple web form validation project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to validate user input in a web form before submission. The form includes fields for username, email address, mobile number, password, and confirm password. It checks for various validation rules, displays error messages for invalid inputs, and ensures that the password and confirm password fields match.
